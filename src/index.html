                  been experiencing different symptoms of different illnesses,
                  never being able to pinpoint down what it was. We found Angel
                  Longevity Medical Center. I had a whole hour with the Doctor
                  and we discussed everything that was going on. She told me
                  that she's gonna get to the bottom of it and get to the root
                  cause. I immediately started feeling results. What impressed
                  me is how fast I was able to feel good with the treatments I
                  was getting. I'm in the best shape. I am in the best health.”

                  problem was. Dr. Mathur was confident that she could handle
                  the situation. She found the exact things that were causing it
                  and we handled them with safe, natural protocols that didn't
                  cause side effects. Within 2-3 weeks I was back to having

                  Angel Longevity Medical Center Success: “The reason because I
                  chose to come and see Dr. Mathur was because she has a
                  different approach. I've been fat since I remember, it's
                  always been trying to figure it out, I would lose maybe 25-30
                  pounds and yo-yo back. I wanted try something different and
                  when I read she does different treatments, not just an HCG
                  diet but also treatments that can help the way my body reacts
                  to food or to understand the way my body reacts to food I
                  thought it was very cool to try that out and it's been very
                  successful so far. They think outside the box, every time
                  there was something that stopped my progress then they went
                  back and tried to figure out the root of everything that was
                  going on with myself. They just never give up, they text me
                  all the time they are always checking that I am good health
                  wise and emotionally. It makes me feel different and excited
                  about actually getting healthy.” — Ivonne Alas

            <p class="answer">
              Yes and no. We do not bill insurance. Watch the video to
              understand why. We offer super bills for the services you receive
              and many of our patients are able to get at least partial
              reimbursement when they submit the super bills. Additionally your
              insurance may help offset the cost of your lab work. Many of the
              labs we work with will bill your insurance for lab work that the
              doctor orders.

              Does the doctor treat "my specific problem"?

            <p class="answer">
              Many people want to know if we treat a specific problem. Sometimes
              the only one who can answer that question is the doctor. Keep in
              mind that we treat the underlying cause of health problems not the
              symptoms. The purpose of your new patient consultation is to make
              sure we can help you with the specific issues you are dealing
              with. Our New patient coordinator will be going over this with
              you.

              Of course there are no guarantees when it comes to health care,
              however, our success rate is 85% or more. The main criteria as to
              whether you are likely to get well are as follows
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              1. You want to get well. Believe it or not this is not always the
              case. But if you want to get well and believe you can then we are
              very likely to be in the 85% that get very good results.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              2. You are willing to follow the doctor's recommendations. The key
              here is to recognize that there may be some lifestyle changes etc.
              If the doctor determines that there are things you are doing that
              are detrimental to you getting well and you will not work to
              change them then it could undermine your progress.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              That's pretty much it. If you are willing to fit into the above
              two criteria then you should enjoy great success.
