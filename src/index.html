                  brochure for the past 6 years, and pretty much all my new
                  patients come from that! Like we measure it and even patients
                  that say they found us online, on Facebook, on Instagram or
                  whatever, we'll ask him a little bit more questions and we'll
                  find out that they first saw us through our mailer.” — Dr.

              Yes and no. We do not bill insurance. Watch the video to
              understand why. We offer super bills for the services you receive
              and many of our patients are able to get at least partial
              reimbursement when they submit the super bills. Additionally your
              insurance may help offset the cost of your lab work. Many of the
              labs we work with will bill your insurance for lab work that the
              doctor orders.

              Does the doctor treat "my specific problem"?

            <p class="answer">
              Many people want to know if we treat a specific problem. Sometimes
              the only one who can answer that question is the doctor. Keep in
              mind that we treat the underlying cause of health problems not the
              symptoms. The purpose of your new patient consultation is to make
              sure we can help you with the specific issues you are dealing
              with. Our New patient coordinator will be going over this with
              you.

            <p class="answer">
              Of course there are no guarantees when it comes to health care,
              however, our success rate is 85% or more. The main criteria as to
              whether you are likely to get well are as follows
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              1. You want to get well. Believe it or not this is not always the
              case. But if you want to get well and believe you can then we are
              very likely to be in the 85% that get very good results.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              2. You are willing to follow the doctor's recommendations. The key
              here is to recognize that there may be some lifestyle changes etc.
              If the doctor determines that there are things you are doing that
              are detrimental to you getting well and you will not work to
              change them then it could undermine your progress.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              That's pretty much it. If you are willing to fit into the above
              two criteria then you should enjoy great success.
